# Polyform Puzzler

This is a fork of David Goodger's polyform puzzler code (https://puzzler.sourceforge.net/). The code has been modified so it works with python 3.8+. To install simply change to the puzzler directory and use pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
This fork of polyform puzzler uses the `xcover` package, which can be found at https://github.com/johnrudge/xcover.
