   **(2008-11-05) Sudoku Solver Added**
       Added software to solve Sudoku puzzles, using the same core
       engine that solves polyform puzzles.  `See the Sudoku section of
       the README file. <README.html#sudoku>`__

   **(2008-04-13) Polyform Puzzler Talk Video (Montreal Python)**
       `Video of my February 7 talk at the Montreal Python users group
       meeting is now up on the web.
       <http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4654600992090030361>`__
       It was a lot of fun, and the group seemed to enjoy it.

   **(2007-04-06) SVG Image Generation Added for Polysticks**
       And a couple of new polystick puzzles too!

   **(2006-10-03) Added "How to Extend Polyform Puzzler" Document**
       The beginnings of development instructions; `available here
       <docs/extend.html>`__.

   **(2006-09-22) X3D 3-D Model Generation Added**
       For polycubes (pentacubes, tetracubes, solid pentominoes, soma
       cubes).

   **(2006-09-19) Automatic Save/Restore State Added**
       Added the ability to automatically save & restore the session
       state to a user-specified file (``-S``/``--save-search-state``
       option).

   **(2006-09-12) Pentacubes Plus Puzzles Added**
       Sold under the name "`Super Deluxe Quintillions`_" by Kadon,
       these 30 pieces are the 29 pentacubes plus a second L3 piece
       (a.k.a. J3), allowing the construction of box shapes.

   **(2006-09-04) Tetracube and Pentacube Puzzles Added**
       Several initial tetracube and pentacube puzzles were added; more
       to come.

   **(2006-08-31 -- 09-03) SVG Image Generation Added**
       For polyominoes, polyiamonds, polyhexes, and polycubes (so far).

   **(2006-08-28) Heptiamond Puzzles Added**
       Four heptiamond (order-7 polyiamond, triangle-grid-based) puzzles
       added.

   **(2006-08-26) Hexiamond Puzzles Added**
       Eight hexiamond (order-6 polyiamond, triangle-grid-based) puzzles
       added.

   **(2006-08-21) Tetrahex & Pentahex Puzzles Added**
       Four hexagon-grid-based puzzles added, along with initial unit
       tests.

   **(2006-08-08) Polyform Puzzler 1: first release**
       Ready for download_.  But I recommend downloading the `project
       snapshot`_ or accessing the `SVN repository`_ directly for
       up-to-date code.

   **(2006-08-07) Polyform Puzzler: project open for business**
       Registered on SourceForge in 2000, this project has been dormant
       since.  Not any more!  We now have code in a Subversion
       repository, a mailing list and snapshots.  Get puzzling!

Overview
========

**Polyforms** are sets of all possible shapes constructed from
multiple basic units (squares, triangles, etc.) following some simple
rules.  These shapes can then be combined into larger shapes, often in
many different ways.  These are **polyform puzzles**.  (More info in
the FAQ_.)

**Polyform Puzzler** is a set of solvers for many polyform puzzles
(like Pentominoes and Soma Cubes), and a software toolkit for
exploring & solving polyform puzzles.  It consists of a set of
front-end applications for specific polyform puzzles and a Python
library that does the heavy lifting.  New polyforms and new puzzles
can easily be defined and added.  Python 2.4 or higher is required.

A Sudoku puzzle solver is also included.  The same back-end puzzle
solving engine is used to solve Sudoku puzzles and polyform puzzles.

Here are some examples of polyform puzzles (all solved & drawn by
Polyform Puzzler!):
