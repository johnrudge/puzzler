       up-to-date code.

   **(2006-08-07) Polyform Puzzler: project open for business**
       Registered on SourceForge in 2000, this project has been dormant

Overview
========

**Polyforms** are sets of all possible shapes constructed from
multiple basic units (squares, triangles, etc.) following some simple
rules.  These shapes can then be combined into larger shapes, often in
many different ways.  These are **polyform puzzles**.  (More info in
the FAQ_.)

**Polyform Puzzler** is a set of solvers for many polyform puzzles
(like Pentominoes and Soma Cubes), and a software toolkit for
exploring & solving polyform puzzles.  It consists of a set of
front-end applications for specific polyform puzzles and a Python
library that does the heavy lifting.  New polyforms and new puzzles
can easily be defined and added.  Python 2.5 or higher is required,
but the latest 2.x.y is recommended.

A **Sudoku** puzzle solver is also included.  The same back-end puzzle
solving engine is used to solve Sudoku puzzles and polyform puzzles.

Here are some examples of polyform puzzles (all solved & drawn by
Polyform Puzzler!):

Download
========

* Get the latest `project snapshot`_ (recommended; it's updated
  continually).

* To access the `SVN repository`_ directly use the following
  Subversion command::

      svn co https://puzzler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puzzler/trunk/puzzler

  notifications by mail.

  __ https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/puzzler-checkins

  You can also `browse the repository trunk`__, including the
  `solutions`__ and the `Python source code ("puzzler" package)`__.

  __ http://puzzler.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/puzzler/trunk/
  __ http://puzzler.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/puzzler/trunk/solutions/
  __ http://puzzler.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/puzzler/trunk/puzzler/puzzler/

* Get releases from the `project files page`_ (infrequent and probably
  out of date; I recommend the `project snapshot`_ instead).

* Get `a tarball of the solutions <solutions-snapshot.tgz>`__ (or
  `view the solutions online here <solutions/>`__).
